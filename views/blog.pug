              | The name Glen Hansard felt vaguely familiar to me, but I couldn't put my finger on why until I checked his Spotify discography and realized that he both starred in and wrote music for the movie Once, which I was obsessed with in my freshman year of high school. I had the CD from the library and wore it out, but particularly the song "Falling Slowly". Anyway, this album is pure, good folk/indie rock, the likes of which flourished in the 2010 era but have been on the decline for a | bit now. Glen Hansard is a wonderful singer and songwriter, and although I myself don't consider myself big into this style of music anymore, it's still a treat to hear the genre in the hands of someone who knows what they're doing.

                |I have a soft spot for upbeat, arena-jamming pop-rock about important teenage feelings, and this album is unabashedly so. Opener "The Dark" isn't bad, but a bit odd as an album opener because of how soft and downtrodden it is. The album shines most when the band embraces the fun, fist-pumpy nature of the genre and churns out bangers. As is common with these types of albums, though, the individual 
                |tracks do tend to blend into one another, and the singles are standouts mainly because someone—the band, the studio, a marketing exec, whatever—thought so and selected it as the one to receive promotion. There's certain parts where the lead singer's voice reminds me of Patrick Stump's—am I crazy?

                | We're featuring this mainly because I want to balance out the amount of rock that has been on this week, but I'll readily admit it's not my favorite album this week, and I'm not sure if the reason I like it is more that I enjoy it as much as it is that I just find it interesting to listen to. 
                | The production that has gone into it is pretty interesting, although I do feel like it's the sort of quasi-experimental indie dream noise that has been done before….granted, I don't | |   listen to a lot of quasi-experimental indie dream noise bands, so maybe this one really stands out.

                | I'm featuring this album mostly because it's excellent but at least partially because I know our dutiful co-host Taylor will absolutely hate it. What can I say? I’ll always have a soft spot for thrashy punk. It might be easy to write off DZ Deathrays as yet another shouty noise-rock dump, but the underlying songwriting is
                | fantastic, with loads of catchy hooks and anthemic, sing-along choruses. Don't get fooled by the ugly veneer of grit and grime scuffing up everything, these songs are tight as any good pop song and will stick in your head just as easily.
